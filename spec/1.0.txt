I. Basic Replacements
The following strings will have the former set of characters replaced with the latter
set of characters, so long as the location of the OBJECT TO REPLACE is to the left of
the location of the string "REM". In the base Csharp version this is accomplished
by splitting the line using the string "REM" as the delimiter, then replacing everything
in line[0] and tacking on line[1] at the end. Additionally, the characters '#'
and '//' must be converted to REM before these replacements can take place, so a
pre-replace function may be required.

Case sensitivity should be partial. For example, the word "print" and "PRINT" will
be converted to "ECHO", but "prINt", "Print" and "prinT" would not. So either all-uppercas
or all-lowercase ONLY will be converted.

	EXAMPLE LINE; print Hello REM This uses print command
	EXAMPLE MODIFIED: ECHO Hello REM This uses print command
	
Replacements :
	-START-  => @ECHO OFF
	-STARTX- => @ECHO off\r\nSETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS
	-END-    => REM BatchX <version>
	-ENDX-   => REM BatchX <version>
	PRINT    => ECHO
	IMPORT   => CALL
	
Ia. Capitalize First Word
According to the Batch command list on ss64, any occurrence of any command will
trigger a replacement so long as said command has an IndexOf 0. Then, the command
will be replaced with uppercase with .ToUpper(). This is not yet implemented
in version 1.0.0.
	EXAMPLE LINE: goto xxxx
	EXAMPLE MODIFIED: GOTO xxxx
