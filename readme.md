# BatchX 1.0
BatchX is a transpiler that converts BatchX code to working Batch code for Windows.

## Spec
See spec/<version>.txt for information about the product specification. The most current
spec is 1.0, which is in the "drafting" phase.

## Building
You can build this using Mono or Visual C#. On Mono, use compileBatchx.bat.

## Rewrite
This is a rewrite of the old BatchX, which had grown far too large. Since this is mostly
a ground-up rewrite it will take a while to incorporate many features that were in
BatchX v0.3.3, the latest stable release of the old BatchX.
